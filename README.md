Had this problem as an interview question recently.

Given a string representing a grid of weights find the highest
weighted path through the grid. Rows are deliminated by ';' 
and columns are deliminated by ','.

The exemple grid given is '1,2,3;6,5,4;8,-7,9' so this example
has that grid hardcoded in. The example is used because just
choosing the best direction at each node will not give the 
highest possible path.
